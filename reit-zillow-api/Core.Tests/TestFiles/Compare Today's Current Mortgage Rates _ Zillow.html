A home loan with a shorter term may have a lower interest rate but a higher monthly payment, while a home loan with an adjustable interest rate may have a lower interest rate at first but then change annually after a set period of time. For example, a 7-year ARM (adjustable-rate mortgage) has a set rate for the initial 7 years then adjusts annually for the remaining life of the loan (loan term), while a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has a rate that stays the same over the loan term.</p>"}}]}</script><script type="application/ld+json" id="mortgage-rates-faq-jsonld">{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"FAQPage","@id":"custom-quotes-faq-jsonld","mainEntity":[{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"What is a mortgage rate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">A mortgage rate is a percentage of the total loan amount (i.e. the rate of interest) paid by the borrower to the lender for the term of the loan.

The lender will consider a number of factors in determining a borrower&#x27;s mortgage rate, such as the borrower&#x27;s credit history, down payment amount or the home&#x27;s value. Inflation, job growth and other economic factors outside the borrower&#x27;s control that can increase risk also play a part in how the lender sets their rates.

Pay specific attention to which lender has the lowest mortgage rate, APR, and projected principal and interest payment. Then review the Origination Charges located on the Loan Estimate under Loan Costs to see how much the lender is charging in fees (also reflected in the APR). The higher the fees and APR, the more the lender is charging to procure the loan. The remaining costs are generally applicable to all lenders, as they are determined by services and policies the borrower chooses, in addition to local taxes and government charges.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"What is the difference between interest rate and APR?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">Interest rate is a percentage of the total loan balance paid to the lender on a monthly basis (i.e. the cost of borrowing money from the lender). The annual percentage rate, or APR, is the total borrowing cost as a percentage of the loan amount, which includes the interest rate plus any additional fees like discount points and other costs associated with procuring the loan.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"What is a mortgage point?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">Some lenders may use the word &quot;points&quot; to refer to any upfront fee that is calculated as a percentage of your loan amount. Point is a term that mortgage lenders have used for many years and while some points may lower your interest rate, not all points impact your rate. Mortgage points can be found on the Loan Estimate that the lender provides after you apply for a mortgage.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"What are origination fees?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">An origination fee is what the lender charges the borrower for making the mortgage loan. The fee may include processing the application, underwriting and funding the loan as well as other administrative services. Origination fees generally do not increase unless under certain circumstances, such as if you decide to go with a different type of loan. For example, moving from a conventional to a VA loan. You can find origination fees on the Loan Estimate.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"What is a discount point?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">Discount points are optional fees paid at closing that lower your interest rate. Essentially, discount points let you make a tradeoff between your closing cost fees and your monthly payment. By paying discount points, you pay more in fees upfront but receive a lower interest rate, which lowers your monthly payment so you pay less over time. Any discount points purchased will be listed on the Loan Estimate.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"How much is a mortgage point?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">Each point equals 1% of the loan amount. For example, one point on a $100,000 loan would be 1% of the loan amount or $1,000. Two points would be 2% of the loan amount or $2,000.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"How much does 1 point lower your interest rate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">The exact amount that your interest rate is reduced depends on the lender, the type of loan, and the overall mortgage market. Sometimes you may receive a relatively large reduction in your interest rate for each point paid. Other times, the reduction in interest rate for each point paid may be smaller. Each lender has their own pricing structure, and some lenders may be more or less expensive overall than other lenders - regardless of whether you&#x27;re paying points or not. When comparing offers from different lenders, ask for the same amount of points or credits from each lender to see the difference in mortgage rates.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"What is a lender credit?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">A lender credit is when a lender gives you money to offset your closing costs. Sometimes this is an exchange for a higher interest rate. When you receive lender credits in exchange for a higher interest rate, you pay less upfront but pay more over time because of the higher interest.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"What is a mortgage rate lock?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">A mortgage rate lock (or &quot;lock-in&quot;) means that your interest rate won&#x27;t change between the day your rate is locked and closing as long as you close within the specified timeframe of the rate lock, and there are no changes to your application. If your interest rate is locked, your rate won&#x27;t change as a result of market fluctuations, but it can still change if there are changes in your application - such as your loan amount, credit score or verified income.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"When should I lock in my mortgage rate?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">When you feel like you&#x27;re receiving the best mortgage rate possible and you&#x27;re worried the rate may increase, it may be a good idea to lock in your rate. Mortgage rates change daily, sometimes even hourly, which is why it&#x27;s ideal to lock-in the mortgage rate when interest rates are at their lowest.</p>"}},{"@context":"http://schema.org","@type":"Question","name":"How does the Federal Reserve affect mortgage rates?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"<p class=\"Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 cQbExF\">Home loans with variable rates like<!-- --> <!-- -->adjustable-rate mortgages<!-- --> <!-- -->(ARM) and<!-- --> <!-- -->home equity line of credit loans<!-- --> <!-- -->(HELOC) are indirectly tied to the federal funds rate.

There is no exact formula, which is why mortgage rates typically vary from lender to lender.</p></div></li><li class="StyledAccordionItem-c11n-8-64-1__sc-1bjy1ej-0 dxslFk"><div aria-controls="__c11n_g9650" aria-expanded="false" id="__c11n_g964z" tabindex="0" role="button" class="StyledAccordionHeader-c11n-8-64-1__sc-1aql0oo-0 jjdzg"><svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img" class="Icon-c11n-8-64-1__sc-13llmml-0 jNBRYk"><title>Chevron Down</title><path stroke="none" d="M29.41 8.59a2 2 0 00-2.83 0L16 19.17 5.41 8.59a2 2 0 00-2.83 2.83l12 12a2 2 0 002.82 0l12-12a2 2 0 00.01-2.83z"></path></svg><div class="Flex-c11n-8-64-1__sc-n94bjd-0 kowuYQ"><h3 class="Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledHeading-c11n-8-64-1__sc-ktujwe-0 jsYfsK">How to compare mortgage rates?</h3></div></div><div aria-labelledby="__c11n_g964z" id="__c11n_g9650" hidden="" role="region" class="StyledAccordionPanel-c11n-8-64-1__sc-1xie7x7-0 kzuTpg"><p class="Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 jVFNwS">While online tools, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-rates/#top" class="Anchor-c11n-8-64-1__sc-hn4bge-0 fCrkWm">such as our mortgage rate comparison tool above</a>, allow you to compare current average mortgage rates by answering a few questions, you'll still want to compare official Loan Estimates from at least three different lenders to ensure you are getting the best mortgage rate with the lowest monthly payment.</p><p class="Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 jmuLJT">After applying for a mortgage, the lender will provide a Loan Estimate with details about the loan.

However if you suspect a federal increase is about to happen or it has just happened, you'll want to move fast if you're looking to make changes or have yet to lock in a fixed-rate mortgage.</p></div></li></ul></div></div><div class="zgmi__sc-6ng9gv-0 hSwYUF"><div class="StyledCard-c11n-8-64-1__sc-rmiu6p-0 QnFKH zgmi__sc-19b7d9k-0 fcrCPl"><h2 class="Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledHeading-c11n-8-64-1__sc-ktujwe-0 iUQvPe">Mortgage resources</h2><div class="Spacer-c11n-8-64-1__sc-17suqs2-0 kWQjCG"><ul class="List-c11n-8-64-1__sc-1smrmqp-0 zgmi__sc-1l7g797-0 cnNyii fRAguH"><li class="ListItem-c11n-8-64-1__sc-10e22w8-0 dNkEbe"><div class="Flex-c11n-8-64-1__sc-n94bjd-0 iXDNOi"><div class="zgmi__sc-1l7g797-1 gwBrdG"><svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img" class="Icon-c11n-8-64-1__sc-13llmml-0 ToXDy"><title>Calculator</title><g stroke="none"><path d="M26,4V28H6V4H26m0-2H6A2,2,0,0,0,4,4V28a2,2,0,0,0,2,2H26a2,2,0,0,0,2-2V4a2,2,0,0,0-2-2Z"></path><path d="M22,8v3H10V8H22m1.5-2H8.5a.5.5,0,0,0-.5.5v6a.5.5,0,0,0,.5.5h15a.5.5,0,0,0,.5-.5v-6a.5.5,0,0,0-.5-.5Z"></path><path d="M11,16H9a1,1,0,0,0,0,2h2a1,1,0,0,0,0-2Z"></path><path d="M17,16H15a1,1,0,0,0,0,2h2a1,1,0,0,0,0-2Z"></path><path d="M17,20H15a1,1,0,0,0,0,2h2a1,1,0,0,0,0-2Z"></path><path d="M23,16H21a1,1,0,0,0,0,2h2a1,1,0,0,0,0-2Z"></path><path d="M11,20H9a1,1,0,0,0,0,2h2a1,1,0,0,0,0-2Z"></path><path d="M23,20H21a1,1,0,0,0,0,2h2a1,1,0,0,0,0-2Z"></path><path d="M17,24H15a1,1,0,0,0,0,2h2a1,1,0,0,0,0-2Z"></path><path d="M11,24H9a1,1,0,0,0,0,2h2a1,1,0,0,0,0-2Z"></path><path d="M23,24H21a1,1,0,0,0,0,2h2a1,1,0,0,0,0-2Z"></path></g></svg></div><h3 class="Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledHeading-c11n-8-64-1__sc-ktujwe-0 fYkEIY">Mortgage calculator</h3><p class="Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 lgLkdw">Quickly estimate your monthly mortgage payments for a new home.</p><div class="zgmi__sc-1l7g797-2 fWknBH"><a href="https://www.zillow.com/mortgage-calculator" class="StyledButton-c11n-8-64-1__sc-wpcbcc-0 hNrTOo">Calculate your mortgage</a></div></div></li><li class="ListItem-c11n-8-64-1__sc-10e22w8-0 dNkEbe"><div class="Flex-c11n-8-64-1__sc-n94bjd-0 iXDNOi"><div class="zgmi__sc-1l7g797-1 gwBrdG"><svg viewBox="0 0 32 32" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" role="img" class="Icon-c11n-8-64-1__sc-13llmml-0 ToXDy"><title>Checklist</title><g stroke="none"><rect x="17" y="10" width="6" height="2" rx="1"></rect><path d="M26,4V28H6V4H26m0-2H6A2,2,0,0,0,4,4V28a2,2,0,0,0,2,2H26a2,2,0,0,0,2-2V4a2,2,0,0,0-2-2Z"></path><path d="M14.73,7.78a.9.9,0,0,0-1.3,0l-2.21,2.36-.65-.69a.88.88,0,0,0-1.3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1.38l1.3,1.38a.87.87,0,0,0,1.3,0l2.86-3A1,1,0,0,0,14.73,7.78Z"></path><path d="M14.73,14.78a.9.9,0,0,0-1.3,0l-2.21,2.36-.65-.69a.88.88,0,0,0-1.3,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1.38l1.3,1.38a.87.87,0,0,0,1.3,0l2.86-3A1,1,0,0,0,14.73,14.78Z"></path><rect x="17" y="17" width="6" height="2" rx="1"></rect><rect x="17" y="23" width="6" height="2" rx="1"></rect><rect x="10" y="23" width="4" height="2" rx="1"></rect></g></svg></div><h3 class="Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledHeading-c11n-8-64-1__sc-ktujwe-0 fYkEIY">Get pre-qualified</h3><p class="Text-c11n-8-64-1__sc-aiai24-0 StyledParagraph-c11n-8-64-1__sc-18ze78a-0 lgLkdw">Need help financing a new home purchase?
